## New things I learnt during this time
- A/B testing: Everything we did was behind a feature flag. I learnt a lot about how A/B testing is done. How data is collected from intial ramps. Did lots of debugging for multiple projects based on this data. Also got to see very interesting insights on what all goes when we try to launch any change to checkout pages which takes in so much traffic and are so important.

- Design Systems
  - Led the effort for Subscription tech stack migration. This involved understanding current system design and proposing the new system design using the new tech stack. Getting architecture/security/analytics/product review and signoff
    - Understood plantUML
    - Learnt how to think about things at high level and low level
    - Learnt how to create and present effective design docs
