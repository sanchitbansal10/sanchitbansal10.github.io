## Role Overview
This was my first full time role after graduation. It was a complete startup culture and I was given independence and responsibility from day 1 to build things. Probably the best decision of my career to start with a smaller company, because in these 2 years I got lot more experience than I believe I would have gotten anywhere else. Was directly working with CTO and other engineering leaders. It was tough, but worth it.
